# Blockchain Payment Integration

This document describes the blockchain payment integration features implemented in the Rizeos job portal.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Wallet Connection
- **Phantom Wallet Integration**: Users can connect their Phantom wallet to the platform
- **Wallet Status Display**: Shows connection status and balance in the navbar
- **Installation Guide**: Provides guidance for users who don't have Phantom installed

### 2. Payment Flow
- **Platform Fee**: 0.01 SOL fee required to post a job
- **Payment Modal**: Step-by-step payment process with clear instructions
- **Demo Mode**: Simulated transactions for testing purposes
- **Transaction Logging**: Backend logging of all payment transactions

### 3. Backend Integration
- **Blockchain Service**: Handles Solana and Polygon blockchain operations
- **Payment History**: Tracks all user payments
- **Dummy Payment System**: Simulates real blockchain transactions for demo

## How It Works

### Frontend Flow
1. User fills out job posting form
2. Clicks "Post Job" button
3. Payment modal opens if wallet not connected
4. User connects Phantom wallet
5. Payment modal shows fee details and balance
6. User confirms payment
7. Dummy transaction is processed
8. Job is posted after successful payment

### Backend Flow
1. Receives payment request from frontend
2. Processes dummy payment through blockchain service
3. Logs payment transaction
4. Returns transaction hash to frontend
5. Job is created with payment information

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend (.env)
VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
VITE_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS=11111111111111111111111111111112

# Backend (.env)
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
```

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "@solana/web3.js": "^1.87.6",
  "@solana/wallet-adapter-base": "^0.9.23",
  "@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom": "^0.9.24",
  "web3": "^4.3.0"
}
```

## Demo Features

### Dummy Payment System
- Simulates real blockchain transactions
- Generates mock transaction hashes
- Updates wallet balance locally
- Logs payments in backend memory

### Wallet Integration
- Connects to Phantom wallet extension
- Displays wallet address and balance
- Handles connection/disconnection
- Shows installation guide if needed

## API Endpoints

### Blockchain Routes
- `POST /api/blockchain/log-payment` - Log payment transaction
- `GET /api/blockchain/payment-history` - Get user payment history
- `GET /api/blockchain/transaction-history` - Get transaction history
- `POST /api/blockchain/create-wallet` - Create blockchain wallet
- `GET /api/blockchain/balance` - Get wallet balance

## Components

### Frontend Components
- `WalletContext.tsx` - Manages wallet connection state
- `PaymentModal.tsx` - Handles payment flow
- `WalletInstallGuide.tsx` - Guides users to install Phantom
- `Navbar.tsx` - Displays wallet status

### Backend Services
- `blockchainService.js` - Core blockchain operations
- `blockchain.js` - API routes for blockchain operations

## Testing

### Demo Mode
1. Install Phantom wallet extension
2. Connect wallet to the application
3. Try posting a job
4. Complete the payment flow
5. Verify job is posted with payment info

### Real Blockchain Integration
To enable real blockchain transactions:
1. Update RPC URLs to mainnet
2. Replace dummy payment functions with real transactions
3. Add proper error handling for network issues
4. Implement transaction confirmation monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Demo Mode Security
- All transactions are simulated
- No real funds are transferred
- Mock transaction hashes are generated
- Balance updates are local only

### Production Security
- Use secure RPC endpoints
- Implement proper wallet verification
- Add transaction signing validation
- Monitor for failed transactions
- Implement retry mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon)
- Smart contract integration
- Automated payment processing
- Transaction monitoring dashboard
- Payment analytics

### Technical Improvements
- Real blockchain transaction implementation
- Gas fee optimization
- Transaction batching
- Off-chain payment channels
- Cross-chain bridges
