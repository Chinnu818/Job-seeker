# AI Features Documentation

## Overview

The Rizeos platform now includes advanced AI-powered features to enhance job matching, resume analysis, and career development. These features leverage natural language processing and machine learning to provide personalized insights and recommendations.

## Features

### 1. Job ↔ Applicant Matching

**Description**: NLP model to show "match score" based on job description and candidate bio.

**Features**:
- **Comprehensive Match Analysis**: Analyzes job requirements against candidate skills and experience
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides specific feedback on match quality
- **Skill Breakdown**: Shows matched skills and missing skills
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Offers actionable advice for improvement
- **Score Visualization**: Visual progress bar and color-coded match levels

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/ai/match-job`

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Frontend usage
const matchResult = await calculateJobMatch(jobId, jobRequirements);
// Returns: { score, feedback, matchedSkills, missingSkills, recommendations }
```

### 2. Resume Skill Extraction

**Description**: Parse the uploaded resume or bio to auto-fill the top skills.

**Features**:
- **Multi-format Support**: Accepts text input and file uploads (.txt, .pdf)
- **Advanced Skill Detection**: Uses NLP to identify technical skills, programming languages, frameworks, and tools
- **Experience Level Analysis**: Determines skill proficiency levels
- **Key Highlights Extraction**: Identifies notable achievements and experiences
- **Profile Integration**: Automatically suggests skills to add to user profile

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/ai/extract-resume-skills` - Extract skills from resume text
- `POST /api/ai/analyze-resume` - Full resume analysis with profile suggestions

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Extract skills only
const skills = await extractSkillsFromResume(resumeText);
// Returns: { skills: [{ name, level, yearsOfExperience }], experienceLevel, keyHighlights }

// Full analysis
const analysis = await analyzeResumeAndSuggest(resumeText);
// Returns: { extractedSkills, profileImprovements, missingInfo, strengths }
```

### 3. Smart Suggestions

**Description**: Recommended jobs or connections based on profile.

**Features**:
- **Job Recommendations**: AI-powered job suggestions based on skills and experience
- **Connection Suggestions**: Professional networking recommendations
- **Career Advice**: Personalized career development tips
- **Match Scoring**: Percentage-based matching for all suggestions
- **Real-time Updates**: Fresh suggestions based on current profile and available opportunities

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/ai/smart-suggestions` - Get personalized job and connection suggestions
- `GET /api/ai/job-alerts` - Get personalized job alerts

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Get smart suggestions
const suggestions = await getSmartSuggestions();
// Returns: { jobSuggestions, connectionSuggestions, careerAdvice }
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

**AI Service** (`services/aiService.js`):
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for advanced analysis
- **Local Fallback**: Implements local NLP processing when OpenAI is unavailable
- **Skill Dictionary**: Comprehensive tech skills database
- **Similarity Algorithms**: Jaccard similarity for skill matching

**Key Methods**:
- `calculateJobMatch()` - Job-candidate matching with detailed analysis
- `extractSkillsFromResume()` - Resume skill extraction
- `generateSmartSuggestions()` - Personalized recommendations
- `analyzeResumeAndSuggest()` - Full resume analysis

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

**AI Context** (`contexts/AIContext.tsx`):
- Centralized AI state management
- Loading states and error handling
- Type-safe API interactions

**Components**:
- `JobMatchCard.tsx` - Visual job matching results
- `ResumeAnalyzer.tsx` - Resume upload and analysis interface
- `SmartSuggestions.tsx` - Recommendations display
- `AI.tsx` - Main AI features page

## Usage Guide

### For Job Seekers

1. **Job Matching**:
   - Navigate to AI Features → Job Matching
   - Select a job from the dropdown
   - View detailed match analysis and recommendations

2. **Resume Analysis**:

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# OpenAI Configuration (Optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### Dependencies

**Backend**:
```json
{
  "natural": "^6.10.4",
  "compromise": "^14.10.0",
  "string-similarity": "^4.0.4",
  "openai": "^4.20.1"
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequent AI requests
- **Rate Limiting**: AI endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse
- **Fallback Processing**: Local NLP when OpenAI is unavailable
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking AI operations

## Security

- **Authentication**: All AI endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling without exposing sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of AI resources

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced NLP**: Implement more sophisticated language processing
2. **Machine Learning**: Add ML models for better predictions
3. **Real-time Analysis**: Live job matching during application process
4. **Multi-language Support**: Support for multiple languages
5. **Industry-specific Models**: Specialized models for different industries
